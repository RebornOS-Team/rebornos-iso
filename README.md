This is the official **RebornOS ISO** source. 
The ISO configuration can be found [here](configs/releng/).

The upstream for this project is [*ArchISO*](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso).

[Please keep this git repository updated](https://github.com/RebornOS-Team/rebornos-iso#3-update) by git merging with latest upstream changes.

## 1. Cloning

To download the source code for testing, or for development, you can clone from the remote repository using either SSH, or HTTPS:

### HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RebornOS-Team/rebornos-iso.git 
```

OR

### SSH

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RebornOS-Team/rebornos-iso.git
```

## (Optional) Enable local repository

Edit the `pacman.conf` file and uncomment the below lines
```
#[rebornos-iso]
#SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
#Server = file:///var/tmp/local_repo_dir
```
> **Note:** *`file:///var/tmp/local_repo_dir` symlinks to the `local_repo` directory*.

## 2. Build

> **Note**: The script for setting up prerequisites will only build on *Arch Linux* and its derivatives (i.e. on distributions that use `pacman`, and the Arch Linux package repositories)

The below script will build the ISO image (and install any prerequisites). Change to the project directory (`cd rebornos-iso`) and run

```bash
sh scripts/build.sh
```
Check the `output/` directory for the output ISO file.

## 3. Update

To keep this project in sync with the upstream ArchISO Releng configuration, please follow the below steps. Change to the project directory (`cd rebornos-iso`) before continuing...

a. **Fetch changes from the upstream GitLab source**: The below script first clones the [upstream ArchISO](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso) to the `_archiso` branch (force overwrites it) and then clones the [releng configuration directory](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/-/tree/master/configs/releng) to the `_releng` branch.
```sh
sh scripts/update_releng_branch.sh
```

b. **Merge upstream changes**
```sh
git checkout main

git merge _releng
```

c. **Manually handle merge conflicts**: Follow [this guide for commandline operations](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts) or [this guide if you are using *Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_merge-conflicts).

d. **Push updates back to the project**: After all the merge conflicts are handled and you stage all the changes, you are ready to push the updates with `git push`.
